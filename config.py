""" A neural chatbot using sequence to sequence model with
attentional decoder.
This is based on Google Translate Tensorflow model
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/rnn/translate/
Sequence to sequence model by Cho et al.(2014)
Created by Chip Huyen as the starter code for assignment 3,
class CS 20SI: "TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research"
cs20si.stanford.edu
This file contains the hyperparameters for the model.
See readme.md for instruction on how to run the starter code.
